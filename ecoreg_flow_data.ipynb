    "The notebook [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/ECOREG/blob/master/ecoreg_data_exploration.ipynb) documents my initial exploration of the German discharge data for the ECOREG project. In a meeting on 02/05/2016, it was decided that, initially, Jannicke and Susi will collate and process the ecology data while I calculate IHA parameters for all the German and Norwegian flow sites (see Susi's e-mail from 03/05/2016 at 10:20 for more details). \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the tidying and processing of the discharge data. Note that all the relevant raw data files can be found here:\n",
    "\n",
    "K:\\Prosjekter\\Ferskvann\\O-13026 ECOREG\n",

    "I've have also created slightly modified versions of these files on my local drive. These are used as inputs to the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Sampling times for ecology\n",
    "\n",
    "For consistency, wherever possible we would like to calculate the IHA parameters based on **5 years** of discharge data prior to the ecological sampling. The IHA methodology generally uses **water years** running from the **start of October to the end of September**, and the water chemistry and ecological surveys in Norway were all undertaken during **September 2013** (see the *Field data* sheet of *ECOREG_WP1_macroinvertebrate data.xlsx* for details). For Norway, it therefore makes sense to calculate the IHA parameters using discharge data for the five year period from **01/10/2008 to 30/09/2013 (water years 2009 to 2013 inclusive)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The German sites are a little more complicated. The table below shows the various sampling dates for water chemistry and ecology.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB:** I'm guessing that *PB* in the table below relates to benthic algae and *MZB* is the macroinvertebrate data? **Check with Susi**."

In general, the PB and chemistry data seem to be more consistent: unlike MZB, these columns have no missing values and the water sampling and ecological surveys typically take place within the same month. I'm therefore tempted to use these columns to define the IHA discharge time periods.\n",

However, the MZB surveys for **Bamenohl**, **Boerlinghausen** and **Bredelar** are very old compared to the PB and chemistry data - so old, in fact, that the MZB surveys predate the 5 year window under consideration for the discharge parameters. In addition, the flow regime at Bamenohl is unusual (see the [previous notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/ECOREG/blob/master/ecoreg_data_exploration.ipynb) for more details). It might therefore be a good idea to **remove these sites from further consideration**. This is done below, but can be easily changed again later if desired."

One drawback of standard PCA is that it is very sensitive to such outliers, and in this case the direction of the first eigenvector looks to be determined largely by this single point. If site S2.611 was removed from the analysis, the first PC would actually have less variance than the second, so this plot could be misleading: given that these points are projections from a 32 dimensional space, it is possible that a different affine transformation could achieve better separation of the other points if S2.611 was removed. Let's test this.\n",

    "This gives us a slightly different view of the data, although the conclusions are largely the same. Many of the Norwegian sites are hydromorphologically distinct from the German ones, to the extent that drawing a single straight line on the plot above would do a fairly good job of separating the points into two classes. There are, however, a handful of Norwegain sites (approximately 8 looking at the plot above) that are essentially indistinguishable from the German ones. A brief exploration of this \"confusion\" (e.g. comparing the plot above with the histograms showing the Julian day of maximum and minimum flows) suggests that, unfortunately, these points do not have a straightforward explanation in terms of individual IHA parameters. It might be interesting to look at the geographical location of these sites though?"
