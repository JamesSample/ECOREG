# ECOREG

This project investigated the relationships between flow regulation, water chemistry and aquatic ecology at a range of river sites in Germany and Norway. The work was undertaken by the [Norwegian Institute for Water Research (NIVA)](http://www.niva.no/) and was funded by the [Research Council of Norway](http://www.forskningsradet.no/en/Home_page/1177315753906) (221398/E40).

The analysis took place in three main stages. Technical details are provided at the following links:

 1. [Hydrological regimes and dimesnionality reduction](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/ECOREG/blob/master/final_analysis/ecoreg_full_analysis_1.ipynb) <br><br>
 
 2. [Tests for differences between regulated and unregulated sites](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/ECOREG/blob/master/final_analysis/ecoreg_full_analysis_2.ipynb) <br><br>
 
 3. [Exploring of regression relationships](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JamesSample/ECOREG/blob/master/final_analysis/ecoreg_full_analysis_2.ipynb)
 
 Further notebooks describing the pre-processing and initial exploration of the datasets are available [here](https://github.com/JamesSample/ECOREG/tree/master/exploratory_analysis).
